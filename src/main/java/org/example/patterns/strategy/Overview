1. The STRATEGY pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets us define a family of algorithms, put each of them
into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable. By doing this, our strategies are easily replaceable
and interchangeable by clients at runtime.
2. By following the strategy pattern, we will be able to apply the Single Responsibility and the Open-Closed Principles,
because each strategy is now isolated in a separate class, and we can easily introduce new strategies.

1. The FACTORY METHOD pattern is a creational design pattern which loosens the coupling of a given code by
separating the product's construction code from the code that uses this product.
2. If we have no idea of the exact types of the objects our code will work with, we should use this pattern as it
makes it easy to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the application and hence
allows introducing new types products without breaking existing code.
3. It centralizes the product creation code in one place in the program.

1. The SINGLETON is a creational design pattern. This pattern ensures that only one instance of its kind exists
and provides a single point of access to it from any other part of our application.
2. The singleton pattern should be used when a class must have a single instance available.
3. It disables all means if creating objects of a class except for the special static creation method. This method returns
the existing instance if it has already been created.
4. However, this pattern requires its code to be adapted to handle multiple threads.

1. The ADAPTER pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to
collaborate with one another.
2. It uses inheritance and composition to enable objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate with one
another. To do that, it creates a middle-layer class that serves as a translator.
3. By following the adapter pattern we will be applying the Single Responsibility Principle and the Open-Closed
Principles because the adapting behaviour is now separated and we can introduce new adapters without breaking
existing code.

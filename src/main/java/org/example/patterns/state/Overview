1. The STATE pattern is a BEHAVIORAL design pattern that allows an object alter its behavior
when its internal state changes
2. The state pattern allows us to extract each logic to a separate class and let the context
delegate the behaviour to the corresponding state class
3. By following the state pattern, we will be applying the Single Responsibility and the Open-Closed Principles
because each state is now organised in a separate class, and we can easily introduce new states
